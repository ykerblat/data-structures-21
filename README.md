<h1> Read me file </h1>
<h2> I will use this environment for all my data-structures work this semester. Instructions on how to read this repository can be found in this file. </h2>

This week 1 assignment repository includes the following item: the JS script/file I wrote, all 10 of the text files for the 10 URLs that were listed, and documentation of my work (in a README).

Methodology. In order to "get" the 10 files, I copied and pasted the the starter code 10 times, changing the URL in each iterations. The raw HTML data that was scraped is located in the "scrape data" text file.

_NB. Afterwards, I attempted to write down some code and set some parameters for a "for loop" formula to execute the code 10 times (preceded by the creation of an array), followed by the creation of an index within the loop but this did not work._
